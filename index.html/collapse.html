    A professional is a member of a profession - an accountant, a lawyer, an actuary, etc. It may also be used more broadly to mean anyone with a white collar job. 
    In the context of a house share, it tells you they are probably respectable, trustworthy people that work normal hours (unless they're a junior doctor, I suppose).<br>
     You can expect that they will pay their share of the rent and won't steal your things (that is, perhaps, rather unfair on people with blue collar jobs - most of them aren't thieves either - but that's nevertheless why people mention professional status when considering housemates).<br>

     In the San Francisco Bay Area, “professional” specifically means an office job, not restaurant or retail, both of which imply shift work and chaotic hours. 
     Restaurant can mean that the person works 2pm-midnight, comes home, and has dinner at 2am, for example.<br> “Professional girls” implies to me that the household will have a rhythm and there will be “quiet time,” but you should specifically ask those questions if they’re important to you.
